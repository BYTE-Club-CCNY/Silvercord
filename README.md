# Silvercord 
Ask Silvercord anything about CUNY on your Discord server! Including: the academic schedule, upcoming or current professors, course material & how to best study for it, or upcoming courses to be opened or closed.

# Demo
Coming Soon

# Purpose
Many students including new-comers tend to have many important questions about the school's academics. Despite the information being searchable online, it would be easier to have everything about each school stored
in one place not only for information, but to be interactive and capable of having a discussion about such a topic. 

# Setting Up
Coming Soon
