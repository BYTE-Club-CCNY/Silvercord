# Silvercord 
Ask Silvercord anything about CUNY on your Discord server! Including: the academic schedule, upcoming or current professors, course material & how to best study for it, or upcoming courses to be opened or closed.

# Demo
Coming Soon

# Purpose
Many students including new-comers tend to have many important questions about the school's academics. Despite the information being searchable online, it would be easier to have everything about each school stored
in one place not only for information, but to be interactive and capable of having a discussion about such a topic. 

# Setting Up
Initialize your NPM environment: </br>
```npm install``` </br>
Add token: </br>
Make sure you have the Discord token or request it, and export into your env: </br>
```export token='[put_your_token_here]'```</br>
Run the bot: </br>
```nodemon```</br>


If it is unable to run nodemon </br>
For windows: `npm install -g nodemon`, </br>
For MacOS/Linux: `sudo npm install -g nodemon`, </br>
Let me know if this happened so I can add this in! But it shouldn't be needed.
